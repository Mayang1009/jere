        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ol id="olf"> 
         <li>Security and Privacy Concerns: </li>
            <p>Storing data and applications in the cloud may raise concerns about security and privacy. Businesses need to trust their cloud service provider's security measures and ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.</p>
         <li>Dependence on Internet Connectivity: </li>
            <p>Cloud computing relies heavily on internet connectivity. If there are issues with the internet connection or the cloud service provider's network, it can disrupt access to critical applications and data.</p>
         <li>Limited Control Over Infrastructure: </li>
            <p>When using cloud services, businesses relinquish some control over their infrastructure to the cloud provider. This lack of control may lead to concerns about data sovereignty, compliance, and vendor lock-in.</p>
         <li>Downtime and Service Outages: </li>
            <p>Despite high availability guarantees from cloud providers, service outages and downtime can still occur due to technical issues, maintenance, or cyberattacks. Businesses may experience disruptions in operations during these periods.</p>
         <li>Potential for Data Loss: </li>
            <p>While cloud providers implement robust backup and disaster recovery solutions, there is still a risk of data loss due to factors such as human error, hardware failure, or malicious attacks. Businesses should implement their own data backup and recovery strategies to mitigate this risk.</p>
